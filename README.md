## Blockchain Fundamentals
A blockchain is a technology that records and shares data over a network, such as the internet. You can think of it as a bunch of computers that allow users to securely record and access data from anywhere on the network. The computers work together to make sure that they all agree on what was recorded. Therefore, we can trust that the system will always have a complete and accurate record of the data.


## Features of Blockchain  

| Term | Description |
| :---: | :----------- |
|Decentralization|A blockchain is decentralized, because all the users can simultaneously edit the blockchain. Every user always has direct access to the blockchain, and no central authority monitors the user transactions.|  
|Trust| The technology is designed so that users can trust that the blockchain accurately records all its data and prevents tampering with that data|
|Record keeping|In a blockchain, each block represents a transaction, and the chain links these transactions over time|
|Transparency| Anyone can review the history of the transactions in a blockchain. This doesn’t mean that anyone can review all the data that the transactions contain. The data itself might be private or sensitive. But, users can verify the existence of the transactions—specifically, who added data to the chain and when. Not all blockchains have full transparency, but it’s a common feature.|

## Advantages of Blockchain

The main advantage of blockchain in decentralization.  Decentralization might sound technical, but its definition in the context of blockchain is just this: a process by which computers around the world copy and maintain a blockchain. These computers might consist of the local machines of Bitcoin users, for example. Unlike a centralized financial system that has one authoritative ledger to record all transactions, the ledger of a blockchain is distributed across all the computers that have a copy of the blockchain. All these computers update the ledger with the current transactions, and no single authority monitors the ledger for problematic transactions. Instead, the blockchain technology itself has fraud prevention built in.

There are different types of black chain such as  permissioned  a blockchain has a trusted, third-party arbiter, and permission less blockchain doesn’t have a central authority to provide trust. In Permission less blockchain people place their trust in the prespecified rules of the blockchain, which are the incentives that keep the users acting appropriately. Bitcoin is an example of a permission less blockchain.  If in the case the people disagree in the mapping of a blockchain a fork creating the new rule is created. This is my trust is important within the block chain process.    

In a ledger that a DataFrame or table represents, each row represents a new entry in the ledger. Similarly, in a ledger that a blockchain represents, each block represents a new entry in the ledger. A block is the most fundamental data structure of the blockchain. It’s essentially a container that holds data. In a blockchain, new entries can be added only to the end of the ledger. That is, a new block can be added only to the end of the chain.

## Blockchain with Python Data Class 
Attached in this Git hub you will find a blockchain created by Python data classes
